I've decided that I'm going to start blogging again. Previously, I had written all about my design work with OpenStack and a bit about the oVirt community work I did. Since then, I've worked on a number of different projects including OpenShift and have recently transitioned to thinking about the Open Hybrid Cloud experience broadly. I'll be sharing my stories as I enter and design for this brave new world. Stay tuned for more posts.
